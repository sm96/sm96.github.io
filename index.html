            Each of your three visualizations must be accompanied by a thorough defense of your design choices (~2-3 paragraphs). Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?
            
            This first visualization aims to answer the question of what MIC values are associated with each bacteria type for each of the three antibacterials.
